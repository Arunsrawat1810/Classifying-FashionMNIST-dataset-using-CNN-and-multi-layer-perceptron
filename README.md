# Classifying-FashionMNIST-dataset-using-CNN-and-multi-layer-perceptron

This project classifies the popular FashionMnist data using deep learning. 2 different architectures : Convulational neural networks (CNN) and multi layer perceptrons are used to classify the data and compare their final results. A further provision to skip connections in the CNNlayers is provided to test for any change in result.
